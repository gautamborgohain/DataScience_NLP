# DataScience_NLP

Project for creating lexicon from datasets using word embedding.
Two methods are explored : W2V embeddings and sentiment specific word embeddings (Tang et al 2014)

The embeddings of the words in the dataset are then used to train a softmax classifer/ MLP with one hidden layer to classify the rest of the vocabulary to respective lexicons
